# CapGate — Wireless Attack Automation Toolkit

> From survival to cybersecurity — building tools that break barriers.

---

CapGate is a modular automation toolkit for wireless attacks, designed to streamline red team operations. Built from scratch using Python, Bettercap, and real-world recon workflows.

## 👤 About Me

I’ve spent most of my life surviving—homeless, locked up, and invisible. One relationship changed everything—it introduced me to the dark side of tech: cyberstalking, spyware, and emotional manipulation. I didn’t have a degree. I didn’t have money. But I had *fire* and *time*. I taught myself dev tooling and cybersecurity from the ground up.

Now, I build tools like CapGate for the people on the frontlines—people like me who don’t come from privilege but build with purpose.
